# HomeLib Framework

This is a framework for creating a custom personal home library page. It is a simple and easy to use framework that allows you to create a custom home library page with a few lines of code. The framework is built using ASP.NET Core and is designed to be easy to customize and extend. The framework includes a number of pre-built components that you can use to create your own custom home library page, including a bookshelf, a reading list, and a search bar. The framework also includes a number of pre-built themes that you can use to customize the look and feel of your home library page. The framework is designed to be easy to use, and requires minimal knowledge of ASP.NET Core to get started. You can create a custom home library page in just a few minutes, and start adding your own books and reading lists right away. The framework is free to use, and is open source, so you can customize it to suit your own needs. If you have any questions or need help getting started, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you enjoy using the framework, and that it helps you create a custom home library page that you love.
